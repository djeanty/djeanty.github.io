<h1>A bit of a programming</h1>
<h2>04 october</h2>
<p>
    I started my evening by deleting almost every line of code from my website and I am rebuilding it from scratch.<br />
    Don't get me wrong, there was about nothing to start with.
</p>
<p>
    This time, I decided to work on a wireframe.
    The website is supposed to, at the time I write these lines, look like this picture.
